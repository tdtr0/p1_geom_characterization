    "text": " To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add the three measurements together and then divide by 3. The three measurements are 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and the increased typing speed after the next lesson, which is 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM. Adding these together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156. Then, divide by 3: 156 \u00f7 3 = 52. Therefore, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.\n\nWait, the problem says \"if he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words\". The second measurement was already 52 WPM. So the third measurement would be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM. Then the three measurements are 47, 52, and 57. Adding them: 47 + 52 is 99, plus 57 is 156. Divide by 3: 156 / 3 is indeed 52. So the average is 52 WPM. That seems correct. But let me double-check the arithmetic. 47 plus 52: 40+50=90, 7+2=9, so 99. Then 99 +57: 99+50=149, plus 7 is 156. Yes. 156 divided by 3: 3 goes into 15 five times, remainder 0, then 6 divided by 3 is 2. So 52. Correct. So the answer is 52 WPM. The solution provided in the example is correct. But wait, the problem says \"the average of the three measurements\". The three measurements are the initial 47, the first increase to 52, and then another increase by 5 (so 57). So yes, those three numbers. The average is indeed 52. So the solution is correct. I think that's all. No mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nThe average of the three typing speed measurements is calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the three measurements:**\n   - First measurement: 47 WPM\n   - Second measurement: 52 WPM\n   - Third measurement (after an additional increase of 5 WPM): \\(52 + 5 = 57\\) WPM\n\n2. **Sum the measurements:**\n   \\[\n   47 + 52 + 57 = 156\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the average by dividing the",

Half of the total diaper changes is:\n10 diaper changes/day / 2 = 5 diaper changes/day.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of diaper changes that Jordan changes.\nSince the wife changes half, Jordan must change the other half. Therefore, Jordan changes:\n10 diaper changes/day - 5 diaper changes/day = 5 diaper changes/day.\n\nAlternatively, since Jordan changes the remaining half, it is also:\n10 diaper changes/day * (1 - 1/2) = 10 diaper changes/day * 1/2 = 5 diaper changes/day.\n\nStep 4: State the final answer.\nJordan changes 5 diapers per day.\n\nFinal Answer: Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.\n\nI think this is correct. Let me double-check.\n\nTotal changes: 2 children * 5 changes each = 10 changes per day.\n\nWife does half: 10 / 2 = 5 changes.\n\nSo Jordan does the other half: 10 - 5 = 5 changes.\n\nYes, that seems right. The problem says \"Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers,\" so it's half of the total changes, not half per child or something else. So the calculation is straightforward.\n\nAnother way to look at it: per child, each has 5 changes. If the wife does half of all changes, then for each child, the wife might do some and Jordan the rest? Wait, but the problem doesn't specify per child, just total. So maybe we shouldn't break it down per child.\n\nSuppose we think per child: each child has 5 changes. If the wife does half of all changes, then for each child, the wife does half of 5? But that would be 2.5 per child, which is not possible since you can't do half a change. But the total is 10, half is 5, which is whole number. So maybe the problem assumes that the total is even, so it works out. So the answer is 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the wife changes half of each child",

    "text": " Joe has $50 to spend. The total cost of the shirt and shorts before any discounts is $25 + $35 = $60. Since there is a 30% off sale, Joe will get 30% off the total price. 30% of $60 is 0.3 * $60 = $18. So, the discounted price is $60 - $18 = $48. Since sales tax is included, Joe will pay the full discounted price of $48. Therefore, Joe will have $50 - $48 = $2 left after the purchase.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{2}\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem says \"assuming that sales tax is included.\" Hmm, so does that mean that the $48 already includes tax, or is the tax applied after the discount? Let me think again.\n\nIn typical sales tax scenarios, the tax is applied after discounts are applied. So the process is usually: first apply the discount to the original price, then add tax on the discounted price. But the problem says \"sales tax is included,\" which might mean that the prices Joe sees already have tax added in. Wait, that could be ambiguous.\n\nWait, let me parse the problem again: \"assuming that sales tax is included.\" So perhaps the $25 and $35 are already including tax? Or is the tax applied after the discount?\n\nHmm, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the problem again carefully:\n\n\"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?\"\n\nThe key phrase is \"sales tax is included.\" That probably means that the prices Joe is paying ($25 and $35) already include the sales tax. So when they say the shirt is $25 and the shorts are $35, those are the total prices including tax. Therefore, the 30% off is applied to the pre-tax amount? Wait, no, that might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is saying that the sales tax is included in the final price Joe has to pay, so we don't have to calculate tax separately. That is, the $25 and $35 are the prices before tax, and after applying the 30% discount, the total is calculated, then tax is added.",
